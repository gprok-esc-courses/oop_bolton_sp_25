# Inheritance and Polymorphism  

A simple payroll system with:  

- Clerk (salary + (overtime * rate))
- Manager (salary + bonus)
- Contract Worker (hour * rate)

1. Version 1: We created a single class with all possible variables. **Problem**: too many if-else-if statemens.
2. Version 2: We created different class for each employee type. **Problem**: We had to create a separate list per type.
3. Version 3: We used Inheritance and Polymorphism, **problems** solved.
